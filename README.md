git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your environment variables
touch .env
```

Your backend `.env` file should look like this:

3.  Run the database migrations (if you have a migration script):
    ```bash
    # Example command
    npm run migrate
    ```

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory (from the root)
cd login-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 5. Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # From the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
